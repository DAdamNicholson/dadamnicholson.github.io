<p> <b>Student feedback:</b></p>
<p>
I have received very positive feedback from students in my courses, with overall ratings that typically exceed departmental and institutional averages. Students frequently comment that I am "very enthusiastic about the material"
and that I regularly bring a "positive and upbeat attitude" to the classroom. Regarding this energy, my students have mentioned that I "made a 2.5 hour class on Monday and Wednesday nights actually fun to come to"
and that I "did a great job keeping students intrigued for the full 2.5 hour lecture." Students have mentioned that I am "very understanding and easy to get in touch with" as well as "very approachable and easy to work with."
Students appreciate that in my classes they "discussed relevant topics and were able to speak freely about our opinions." Regarding my teachings style, students have said: "
I love his teaching style! He explained material in such a way that was really easy to understand and actually helped me retain the information," "He was very engaging.
He made you *want* to talk in class instead of making you just feel like you're required to speak for a grade," and "He has a very effective way of teaching, making class fun & interesting,
so I look forward to class every day, but also making sure we leave the classroom each day with more knowledge of the subject than when we walked in. He is genuinely the best teacher/professor I have had in high school or
college." </p>
