<h2 class="head"> Current Projects </h2>
<p> My current work is predominantly in the area of ethnic and racial inequalities in poverty.
    Overall, my work can be divided into several broad categories, each uniquely addressing the same broader questions of inequality. </p>

<h3 class="head">Poverty and Inequality</h3>
    <p>My primary interest is in issues of poverty and inequality, specifically as it pertains to racial and ethnic differences.
        A portion of work examines the spatial distrubtion of poverty "risks" across states and time to gain a baseline understanding
        of the mechanisms at play.
     </p>

    <figcaption>Figure 7 from "Poverty, Prevalences, and Penalties in U.S. States, 1993-2016" (<i>The Sociological Quarterly</i>)</figcaption>
</figure></center>

<p> Using this information, I am able to approach a number of related issues, such as racial and ethnic inequalities. For example, despite
    both public policy and academic work that puts the blame on impoverished communities for being poor as a result of undesireable behaviors,
    I was able to show that these risks cannot explain ethnic and racial disparities in poverty. </p>

</figure>

<p> Additionally, I am working on a project that shows that higher levels of unionization are associated with not just lower poverty levels
    for white, Black, and Latinx workers, but also reduces gaps between Black or Latinx workers and white workers. </p>

</figure>

<h3 class="head">Political Aspects of Inequality</h3>
    <p>In terms of understanding the broader political structures that affect poverty-related outcomes, I've done work on various aspects related to
    partisanship, political polarization, social conflict, and social change. One such project examined the constraints Black protestors face, as they
    are often perceived as increasing the liklihood of violence. </p>

        in Social Movement Perceptions and Support" (<i>Mobilization</i>)</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p> In addition to social movements, I'm very interested in the impacts of political polarization and partisan politics. Similarly, I typically
        incorporate consideration of electoral politics into my work. As such, I'm currently building a dataset of information on state legislators
        that I plan to make publically available.

<h3 class="head">Veterans Social Mobility Project</h3>
    <p>I am in the early stages of a study on social mobility and well-being in veterans of the armed services that I am very excited about,
        and that bridges inequality, mobility, and health scholarship. Many people (disproportionately poor and racial/ethnic minorities)
        choose to enter the military to pay for college or gain skills with hopes of achieving upward social mobility. However, while some
        are successful in this pursuit, many are left with lifelong physical and mental health traumas. Through a series of semi-structed
        interviews I am planning, I hope to shed light on these experiences and challenge the perception of the military as practical and
        desirable option for upward social mobility. My own experiences as a veteran give me specific insights into these experiences,
        while lending also affording credibility as an interviewer and access to veteransâ€™ networks and groups.

</figure>

<h3 class="head">Additional Interests</h3>
    <p>In addition to those listed above, I'm interested in a number of different topics related to the political and economic structures
    that shape poverty and inequality and the lives and experiences of the individuals behind the numbers. I'm always looking for ways to
    expand my work. Feel free to <a href="mailto:nicholson.365@osu.edu">reach out</a> with quesetions or comments related to my research.</p>
